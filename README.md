# wiki-translated-100-times

Wiki Translated 100 times will be a random project I will work on for a few weeks or months.
I will get a random Wiki page and just translate the text 100 times and update the site.

Current Page: Cheese

**Don't press any links because it will bring you to a 404 page and don't mind if some assests are missing.**

I have no affliation with Wikipedia and also there may be times that the full page won't be translated, but they should be fully done within a couple of days of release.
